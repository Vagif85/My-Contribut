## I am a Senior Ambassador in the Moonbeam Project. 
Also, my team and I have created and run a [RU YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1t2t8VqWmekToiPdbbytNQ)

We work in Media and translate videos from English to Russian (translation and editing, voice acting, voice processing, images).

For the Russian-speaking community. To increase audience, engagement and accessibility.

Thus, we help three parties to be useful (for personal growth, for the project and for the community)! My role is voicing Derek.
